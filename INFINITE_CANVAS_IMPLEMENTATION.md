# Infinite Canvas Implementation

This document outlines the implementation of an infinite rendering canvas with WebGL, following the step-by-step plan provided.

## Implementation Overview

The infinite canvas feature has been fully implemented with the following components:

### 1. Canvas + Rendering Setup ✅
- **File**: `app/pages/design/[id].vue`
- WebGL rendering surface matches browser viewport automatically via `resizeCanvas()`
- Rendering loop clears screen, applies camera transforms, draws objects, and repeats

### 2. Camera State ✅
- **File**: `app/utils/webgl/camera.ts`
- Camera maintains:
  - `position: { x, y }` - Pan position in world space
  - `zoom` - Scale factor (clamped between 0.1 and 10.0)
  - `minZoom` and `maxZoom` - Prevents infinite precision issues
- Reactive state updates on input events

### 3. Transforms ✅
- **File**: `app/utils/webgl/camera.ts`, `app/utils/webgl/render.ts`
- Complete transformation pipeline:
  - World space coordinates for all objects
  - View transform via `getViewMatrix()` applies camera pan/zoom
  - Projection transform maps to screen space
- Transform applied to all rendered objects via `updateUniforms()`

### 4. User Interaction ✅
- **File**: `app/composables/useCameraInput.ts`
- **Panning**: Mouse drag updates camera position
  - Drag delta divided by zoom for smooth panning at any zoom level
- **Zooming**: Mouse wheel adjusts zoom factor
  - Smooth zoom with 0.9/1.1 multiplier
  - Zoom clamped to min/max range (0.1 - 10.0)
  - Zoom focuses on mouse cursor position (keeps point under cursor fixed)

### 5. Objects in World Space ✅
- **Files**: `app/stores/shapeStore.ts`, shape utilities
- All objects (rectangles, circles, triangles, lines) positioned in global coordinate system
- Object positions independent of screen - camera decides visibility
- Coordinates converted between screen and world space:
  - `camera.screenToWorld()` - For click/drag events
  - `camera.worldToScreen()` - For rendering (handled by view matrix)

### 6. Viewport Culling ✅
- **File**: `app/utils/webgl/camera.ts` (lines 80-107)
- `getVisibleBounds()` calculates visible rectangle in world space
- `isVisible()` checks if objects are within visible bounds (with 50px margin)
- Applied in render loop to skip off-screen objects
- Ensures performance with thousands of objects

### 7. Rendering Loop ✅
- **File**: `app/pages/design/[id].vue` (lines 133-225)
- Each frame:
  1. Clear screen with background color (#1E1E1E)
  2. Apply camera transform via `updateUniforms(camera)`
  3. Draw background grid (for infinite illusion)
  4. Draw only visible objects (viewport culling)
  5. Draw hover borders if applicable
  6. Request next frame

### 8. Infinite Illusion ✅
- **File**: `app/utils/shapes/grid.ts`
- Camera can pan and zoom without limits (within reasonable bounds)
- Background grid with 50px spacing in world space
- Grid dynamically generated based on visible bounds
- Grid lines rendered as subtle gray (rgba(0.3, 0.3, 0.3, 0.3))
- Creates perception of endless space

### 9. Performance Basics ✅
- Viewport culling filters objects before rendering
- Grid regenerated each frame but only for visible area
- WebGL buffers and VAOs reused for shapes
- All drawing uses batch draw calls via `gl.drawArrays()`
- Lightweight object data in shape store

## UI Components

### Zoom Controls ✅
- **File**: `app/components/Design/PageDetail.vue`
- Bottom section displays:
  - Current zoom percentage (updated in real-time)
  - Instructions: "Scroll to zoom • Shift+drag to pan"
- Matches design reference with dark theme
- Fixed to bottom of left sidebar

## Key Features

1. **Smooth Panning**: Drag anywhere on canvas to pan
2. **Zoom to Cursor**: Mouse wheel zooms toward cursor position
3. **World Coordinates**: All shapes in consistent world space
4. **Performance**: Viewport culling for thousands of objects
5. **Visual Feedback**: Grid provides spatial reference
6. **Real-time UI**: Zoom percentage updates live

## Integration Points

### Updated Files
1. `app/utils/webgl/camera.ts` - Complete Camera class
2. `app/utils/webgl/render.ts` - Camera transform support
3. `app/utils/shapes/grid.ts` - NEW: Background grid utility
4. `app/components/Design/PageDetail.vue` - Zoom UI component
5. `app/pages/design/[id].vue` - Integrated camera and rendering
6. `app/utils/helpers/draghelper.ts` - World coordinate support
7. `app/composables/useCameraInput.ts` - Already had camera input handlers

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Zoom**: Test min/max bounds (10% - 1000%)
2. **Pan**: Drag in all directions at various zoom levels
3. **Performance**: Add many shapes and test frame rate
4. **Interaction**: Click, drag, and draw shapes at different zoom/pan positions
5. **Grid**: Verify grid appears infinite and aligns properly

## Potential Issues & Notes

### Issue 1: Grid Performance
The grid is regenerated every frame. For very large visible areas (zoomed way out), this could impact performance. Consider caching or using a shader-based grid if issues arise.

### Issue 2: Drag Helper Coordinate System
The drag helper has been updated to use world coordinates. Verify that shape dragging works correctly at all zoom levels and pan positions.

### Issue 3: Shape Drawing
Shape creation now uses world coordinates. Test that clicking to place shapes works correctly with camera transforms.

### Issue 4: Border Rendering
Border drawing needs the same camera transform. Currently applied, but test hover states at various zoom levels.

## Future Enhancements

1. **Touch Support**: Add pinch-to-zoom and touch drag for mobile
2. **Keyboard Shortcuts**: Arrow keys for panning, +/- for zoom
3. **Mini-map**: Small overview showing current viewport position
4. **Zoom Presets**: Buttons for 50%, 100%, 200% zoom
5. **Performance Monitoring**: FPS counter and object count display
6. **Spatial Indexing**: Quadtree or similar for even better culling

## Implementation Status: ✅ COMPLETE

All 9 steps from the original plan have been implemented successfully.
